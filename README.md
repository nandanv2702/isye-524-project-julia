# ISYE 524 Project - Julia Code
The Julia Code for our project will mainly reside in this repo. To see code related to data gathering, generation, and (maybe) visualization, check [this](https://github.com/nandanv2702/isye-524-project) repo.

## How to Contribute
Assuming you have `git` installed on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo by copying the link you see after clicking the green 'Code' button and running the `git clone YOUR_LINK_HERE` command in your terminakl
2. After making any changes, add your files by running `git add .` or `git add FILENAME` to add a particular file
3. Then run `git commit -m "YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE - describes what you changed"`. This "commits" your changes, i.e., tracks them in your local repo
4. To push your changes to GitHub, run `git push -u origin main`. This will push the changes to the main branch.

These are just the steps off the top of my head!
